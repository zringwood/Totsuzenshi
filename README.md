Totsuzenshi is a Japanese term meaning "Sudden Death". It is a drill I do with my students in judo. 

The move around the mat randomly holding one another. When I blow a whistle, they initiate an attack immediately. 
I built this simple application to blow the whistle randomly, so that they're guaranteed to get a good variety of attacks in at different timing. By eliminating the human blowing the whistle, we better simulate the randomness of a real match.
